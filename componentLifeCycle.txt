Lifecycle methods:

A component lifecycle method is a function that we can optionally define inside of our class based components. They we will be automatically called by react
at different points in the lifecycle.

Constructor()
render() (retur some JSX)
componentDidMount()  --  ( called after the JSX first shows up)
... sit and wait for updates....
render() - render will be called many many times :)
componentDidUpdate() -- called when the component updates itself.

... sit and wait  until the component is no longer shown..
componenWillUnmount()
