Rules of class components:
1) Must be a javascript class
2) Must extend the React.component
3) Must define a 'render' method that returns some amount of JSX. 



Rules of state:
1) Only useable with class components ( can use with functional components too with the hooks, but lets save it for later)
2) You will confuse between props and state :|
3) 'State' is a JS object that contains some amount of data that is relevant to a SINGULAR component.
4) Updating the 'state' on a component causes the component to almost instantly rerender. 
4) State must be initialized when a component is created. 
5**) State can be only be updated using the function setState. (Very important)
